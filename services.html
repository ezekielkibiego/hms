<P>Maternal health is the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. In most cases, maternal health encompasses the health care dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience. <br> In other cases, maternal health can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.[1] Maternal health revolves around the health and wellness of pregnant women, particularly when they are pregnant,<br> at the time they give birth, and during child-raising. WHO has indicated that even though motherhood has been considered as a fulfilling natural experience that is emotional to the mother, a high percentage of women develop health problems and sometimes even die.[2] </P>

            <strong>CONSOLTANTS</strong>
            <p>Consultants are senior doctors that have completed full medical training in a specialised area of medicine and are listed on the GMC’s specialist register. They have clinical responsibilities and administrative responsibilities in managing junior doctors.

                They usually work in hospitals or community settings.
                
                After graduating from medical school, it takes around six to eight years to become a consultant.
                
                If they are a surgeon, the title of a consultant is Mr, Mrs, Ms or Professor.
                
                If they are a physician (i.e. non-surgeon) then their title is doctor/Dr.
